            <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, it's time to frost them. Choose from basic <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/easy-chocolate-buttercream-icing-434915">buttercream icing</a>, cream cheese frosting, <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/ganache-520359"> ganache</a>, or whipped cream.<br> If you have two round cakes, put one top side down on the serving platter and frost it. Then put the second cake on top and frost the top and sides. Make swirls as decoration, if desired.â€‹</p>
